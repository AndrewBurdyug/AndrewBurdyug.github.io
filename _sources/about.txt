About me
========
My name is Andrew Burdyug and I'm a Python developer/sysadmin, below are some
of the milestones of my biography.

Good start
----------
In 2008 year I began to work in a small hosting company, It was a great start
to gain experience with:

* bash scripting
* web servers(Apache, Nginx)
* mail servers(Postfix, Exim, Dovecot)
* database servers(MySQL, PostrgeSQL)
* dns servers(Bind, PowerDNS, Unbound, NSD)
* jabber servers(Ejabberd, Prosody)
* monitoring systems(MRTG, RRDtool, Nagios, Icinga, Monit)
* backups(BackupPC, Bacula)
* etc

At that time I began to learn Perl because I wanted to rewrite my old bash scripts
to something more readable/supported, basically these were scripts of automatization
of admin tasks and monitoring checks. I loved perl, thanks to him my scripts
began to better, they grew and became doing more additional things, good things.
It was cool, I began to feel myself like a real 'programmer' and I realized
what exactly I want doing: programming.

Disappointment
--------------
As time went on and I began to notice that my perl scripts become to very complicated
and less supported due to the absence of strict syntax of perl and other things,
at that time I became interested in web programming, but then perl didn't had any
popular/stable web framework, many hours which I spent to dive into perl,
researching the ecosystem of perl, did not lead to satisfaction:
there was no clear syntax rules, there was a lot of magic, lot of CPAN modules,
which may good working today, but not work tomorrow or not working with other
minor version of perl. I was upset. I became interested in other programming languages,
I wanted to try something other instead of Perl, switch from perl programming.

Find yourself or second start
-----------------------------
I saw the two ways: become a ruby developer or python developer. Both languages
actively developed in that time, but I saw that many ex perl developers
switched to Python and they did not regret it, also Python seemed more simple
and expressive for me than Ruby. I started to learn Python and write some scripts
of automatization of my everyday admin tasks, but would like a something more,
then script, sysadmin tasks became a tedious and not interesting for me.

Python
------
In 2013 year I began to work in a small IT company on the position ``python developer``.
The python project, in which I involved, used *Django 1.4.3, Jinja, Fabric, AngularJs,
Git and Agile software development*. I quickly became a *full-stack developer* and *DevOps*.
But I wanted more Python and web technologies, I dived into them in personal
projects and freelance job.

For three years, I became acquainted with many things, here some of them:

* NoSQL databases(MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, ArangoDb)
* Docker ecosystem
* Python web frameworks(Django, Bottle, Flask, Pyramid)
* Python ORM(SQLAlchemy, Pony ORM, Peewee ORM)
* Messaging and task queues(RabbitMq, Celery, Gearman)
* css frameworks(Bootstrap, Pure Css, Kube Css, Semantic UI)
* javascript frameworks(JQuery, AngularJS, Backbone)
* site parsing, crawling, multithreading, asynchronous programming

and many many others cool stuff. And yes, I have never regretted that I've chosen
python and web development.

These days
----------
Now I'm interested in: open source and startups. I have a couple ideas for personal startups,
and wanna focus on them, make something good, something cool, ordinary dreams
of ordinary developer =) I hope you will find something useful for yourself on my blog,
have a nice reading!
